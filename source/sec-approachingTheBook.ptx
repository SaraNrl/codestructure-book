  <title>How to approach this book </title>
  <p>
Please follow the sections of this book in order. You should start here and after finishing each page, use the next button to move to the next page. Each section of this book builds on the previous ones. Skipping ahead makes the material hard to understand.
In the following sessions, you will see various programming-related tasks. Carefully answer the checkpoint questions and complete all activities. After responding to each question, check your answers for correctness. If your answer is incorrect, try again until you get it right, as in this book you will learn through practice and feedback.
